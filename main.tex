\section{``Se\~{n}or, Nobody's Come Out Of There Alive."}

\begin{theorem}
$\NP \subsetneq \NEXP$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let's start by contemplating the following problem:
\begin{mdframed}
\textsc{NCatch22}$^n$

\noindent
$
\hspace{-1pt}
\left.\parbox{0.4\textwidth}{
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.3em]
\item[$\longrightarrow$] A nondeterministic algorithm $N$.
\item[$\longrightarrow$] An integer $t$ in \textit{unary}.
\end{itemize}
}\right\}\;
\text{$n$ bits in total.}\hspace*{\fill}
$
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.3em]
\item[$\longleftarrow$] Accept if there's no path of execution such that $N(N, t)$ accepts within $2^n$ steps. Reject otherwise.
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}
On the one hand, we can solve this problem in deterministic doubly exponential time by just going through all possible lines of execution. This is true even if $N$ varies, not just $t$. Increasing the size of the source code of $N$ isn't \textit{that} catastrophic. So if we give ourselves an expexporbitant budget, we're good. That puts the problem in \textsf{EXPEXP} and thereby in $\NEXPEXP$.

On the other hand, suppose for a moment that we could somehow solve this problem in $f(n) \in o(2^n)$ steps with some nondeterministic algorithm $N^*$. Any such algorithm could be turned back around on itself by asking whether there exists a path of execution such that $N^*(N^*, t)$ accepts within $2^n$ steps. Let $t$ be large enough so that $f(n) \ll 2^n$, then:\\[0.5em]
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
\nameditem{Either there is such a path:} 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\impl $N^*(N^*, t)$ always rejects.
\impl There is no such a path. \lightning
\end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
\nameditem{Or there is no such path:} 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\impl $N^*(N^*, t)$ \textit{someway} accepts within $f(n)$ steps.
\impl There is such a path. \lightning
\end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{minipage}\\[1em]
As we can see, it's impossible for any nondeterministic algorithm to accomplish this task in $o(2^n)$ steps. In particular, because $O\left(2^{n/2}\right) \subseteq o(2^n)$, it's impossible to accomplish this task in $\NTIME\left(2^{n/2}\right)$. And since this class contains all of nondeterministic polynomial time we have
\[
\NP \subseteq \NTIME\left(2^{n/2}\right) \subsetneq \NEXPEXP\,.
\]
Just one small problem. That's one ``\textsf{EXP}" too many. Dang it!

At this point the classical route is to start over and try something cleverer instead: lazy diagonalization.\cite{stanislav} Certainly, that's the way to go if you want to squeeze out the best possible Nondeterministic Time Hierarchy Theorem. But we're not here for elaborately choreographed sword fights. We're here to cleave the polynomial and the exponential apart. So let's just shoot the sucker.

Imagine $\NP = \NEXP$. Then $\NEXP = \NEXPEXP$. How so? \textit{Padding}, that's how. Therefore, by chaining our equalities we get $\NP = \NEXP = \NEXPEXP$. And \textit{that} we know isn't true. QED.

All that's left over is to double check the details involved in the padding. For this take any problem in $\NEXPEXP$. Then there exists a nondeterministic algorithm $J$ which can take an $n$ bit input and accept within $2^{2^{n^k}}$ steps for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, provided the input is a ``yes"-instance. Here's an illustration:
\[
\overbrace{\text{\footnotesize Only the penitent man will pass.}}^{n\text{ bits}}\overset{2^{2^{n^k}}\text{ nondeterministic steps}}{\longleadsto{4}} \text{\footnotesize He kneels!}
\]
If we pad this input, we get a similar problem:
\[
\underbrace{\overbrace{\text{\footnotesize Only the penitent man will pass.}}^{n\text{ bits}}\overbrace{\text{\footnotesize BLABLABLABLABLABLABLABLABLABLA...}}^{\text{An entire book}}}_{2^{n^k}\text{ bits}}\overset{2^{2^{n^k}}\text{ nondeterministic steps}}{\longleadsto{4}} \text{\footnotesize He kneels!}
\]

Since $J$ solves the former in $2^{2^{n^k}}$ steps we can easily modify it to ignore the padding and still solve the latter in $2^{2^{n^k}}$ steps. But this problem now has a size $m = 2^{n^k}$ input. In other words, we can solve the latter problem in $2^m$ steps which now is merely exponential in the size of the input. Therefore, as long as $\NP = \NEXP$, we can also solve the latter problem in $m^l$ steps for some $l\in\mathbb{N}$ using some new algorithm $J'$. And that gives us the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take the $n$ bit input and pad it to length $2^{n^k}$. (And return to the starting position.)
\item Jump to the initial state of $J'$ and run it for the remainder of the computation. 
\end{enumerate}
The first stage takes $O\left(2^{n^k}\right)$ time. The second takes $m^l = \left(2^{n^k}\right)^l = 2^{ln^k}$ time. That's exponential in total. So we've arrived in the promised land: $\NEXP$.
\end{proof}

We have our first separation. And we've added the first of two weapons we'll be using to our belt: padding. Using it and diagonalization we're now equipped to climb the hierarchy.

\begin{exercise}
Which steps in the above proof need to be modified in order to establish $\NEXP \subsetneq \NEXPEXP$?
\end{exercise}

Alright, time to fetch the other weapon.

\begin{theorem}
$\coNP \subsetneq \coNEXP$.
\end{theorem}

It would be quite the hassle if we had to start over. Fortunately, we don't have to. We can simply argue by \textit{symmetry} instead.

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\coNP = \coNEXP$. Then we could prove $\NP = \NEXP$ which we know to be false. This works like so: Take an arbitrary problem in $\NEXP$ and simply interchange the ``yes" and ``no" labels. Now it's a problem in $\coNEXP$ making it a problem in $\coNP$. But that means the unmodified problem is in $\NP$. \lightning
\end{proof}

\section{``Hang On Lady. We're Going For A Ride."}

Time to check our Bingo card.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c"c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& \NEXP & \coNEXP & \interEXP & \unionEXP\\\thickhline
\NP & $\subsetneq$ & & & $\subsetneq$ \\\hline
\coNP & & $\subsetneq$ & & $\subsetneq$ \\\hline

\unionP & & & & \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
I took the liberty of adding some entries that are trivial consequences. Now for the merely elementary consequences. I recommend mentally following along with Figure 1 as you read these.

\begin{theorem}
$\NP\subsetneq\coNEXP$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If
\[
\NP = \coNEXP,
\]
then
\[
\coNP = \NEXP
\]
by symmetry. Hence, by Theorem I and II, $\NP$ and $\coNP$ strictly contain each other. \lightning
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\coNP\subsetneq\NEXP$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By the previous theorem and symmetry.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\interP \subsetneq \interEXP$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\[
\begin{aligned}
\interP & \subseteq \NP & & \text{(duh)}\\
& \subsetneq \NEXP & & \text{(by Theorem 1)}\\
& \subseteq \interEXPEXP & & \text{(by brute force)}
\end{aligned}
\]
Now suppose
\[
\interP = \interEXP.
\]
Then
\[
\interEXP = \interEXPEXP
\]
by padding. Hence,
\[
\interP = \interEXPEXP
\]
which we've just observed to be untrue. \lightning
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\NP \subsetneq \interEXP$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If
\[
\NP = \interEXP,
\]
then
\[
\coNP = \interEXP
\]
by symmetry. Hence, using the fact that, if two sets are equal, then their intersection is unchanged, we see
\[
\NP = \coNP = \interP = \interEXP.
\]
But this is ruled out by the previous theorem. \lightning
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\coNP \subsetneq \interEXP$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By the previous theorem and symmetry.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\unionP \subsetneq \NEXP$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If
\[
\unionP = \NEXP,
\]
then
\[
\unionP = \coNEXP
\]
by symmetry. Furthermore,
\[
\unionEXP = \NEXPEXP
\]
by padding. Putting all this together and using the fact that, if two sets are equal, their union is unchanged, we then get
\[
\NEXP = \coNEXP = \unionEXP = \NEXPEXP.
\]
And that contradicts the conclusion of the first exercise. \lightning
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\unionP \subsetneq \coNEXP$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By the previous theorem and symmetry.
\end{proof}

\section{``Where's The Ten?"}
This is where we're at:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c"c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& \NEXP & \coNEXP & \interEXP & \unionEXP\\\thickhline
\NP & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ \\\hline
\coNP & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ \\\hline
\interP & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ \\\hline
\unionP & $\subsetneq$ & $\subsetneq$ & & $\subsetneq$ \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Only one more to go. And this is the main villain. While $\unionP$ is the ``biggest" set on the polynomial level $\interEXP$ is the ``smallest" set on the exponential level. It doesn't get any closer. Moreover, upon reflection it becomes apparent that every other theorem we've proven so far immediately follows from this one. If we had proven this one first, we could've stopped right there. But that would've been way less fun. And we need to fill our running time somehow, right? Anyway, this one's surely going to be just another pushover. We all but made it.

Dr. Jones Sr.: ``When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment."

At first, one might almost reflexively think that, hey, we've proven both $\NP \subsetneq \interEXP$ and $\coNP \subsetneq \interEXP$. So we're immediately done. But if one thinks about this for just two more seconds, one realizes that this isn't even close to enough. Maybe $\NP$ is the ``left half" of $\interEXP$ and $\coNP$ is the ``right half" (with some overlap).

Fine, let's use our whip then. Suppose $\unionP = \interEXP$. Then by symmetry we get... squat. Nothing happened at all. What if we try the gun? Sure, we could deduce $\unionEXP = \interEXPEXP$. Then what? These puzzle pieces don't fit together.

Indiana: ``Willie! Willie, we're in trouble!"

Things are indeed dire. Padding and symmetry could only bring us so far. We're going to need a new idea. So here's one: If we think back to Theorem VIII where we established $\unionP \subsetneq \NEXP$, there was an alternative proof available. We could've \textit{exhibited} a single problem in $\NEXP$ and shown that this problem is neither in $\NP$ nor $\coNP$. Thereby, it isn't in $\unionP$. What might such a problem be? An $\NEXP$-complete problem of course! Such a problem is in $\NEXP$ and if it is in either $\NP$ or $\coNP$, then the classes collapse. And that can't happen.

Cool. So all we need is an $\interEXP$-complete problem, right? Sure, that would do it. Unfortunately, this is a little tricky. We don't even have $\interP$-complete problems. And believe me people have definitely been looking. But then what hope is there to find an $\interEXP$-complete problem? The closest we can get is $\EXP$-complete problems. But there we no longer have a separation between $\unionP$ and $\EXP$.

Marion: ``Where are you going?"

Indiana: ``Through that wall."

To overcome this problem we'll need one last idea. Namely, while we don't know whether $\unionP \subsetneq \EXP$, it's not too hard to see that if they were equal, then $\NP$ and $\coNP$ would merge into the same class. Therefore, $\unionP = \interP$. But that would make our puzzle pieces fit together! Finally, we're ready.

\begin{theorem}
$\unionP \subsetneq \interEXP$.
\end{theorem}

Just to be thorough, let's double check that $\EXP$ really has complete problems. Here's the simplest of all:

\begin{proof}
\begin{mdframed}
\textsc{Exp-Predict}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.3em]
\item[$\longrightarrow$] An algorithm $A$.
\item[$\longrightarrow$] An input $x$.
\item[$\longrightarrow$] An integer $t$ given in \textit{binary}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0.3em]
\item[$\longleftarrow$] Accept if $A(x)$ accepts within $t$ steps. Reject otherwise.
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}
Any problem in $\EXP$ can easily be reduced to this one in polynomial time by just writing down the fixed size exponential time algorithm, the input under current consideration, and the maximum running time required. Thus, if this problem lies in, say, $\NP$, then all of $\EXP$ follows.

Now for the actual argument. Suppose
\[
\unionP = \interEXP.
\]
Then because $\EXP$ is sandwiched between these classes we also have
\[
\unionP = \EXP.
\]
So take any $\EXP$-complete problem. According to the equality above, this problem must be in either $\NP$ or $\coNP$. Let's assume without loss of generality that it is in $\NP$. Then $\NP$ and $\EXP$ collapse to the same class. And by symmetry the same happens with $\coNP$. Hence,
\[
\NP = \EXP = \coNP.
\]
Consequently,
\[
\interP = \unionP = \interEXP.
\]
But this flies in the face of Theorem V. \lightning
\end{proof}

\section*{Closing Credits}

I originally nuked Theorem X with a variation of Ladner's Theorem. It can still be found at \url{https://github.com/SOberhoff/the_nondeterministic_time_hierarchy/releases/tag/v1.0}. The simpler proof given here was pointed out to me by Scott Aaronson.

\section*{Post Credits Scene}

One can carry out a number of these arguments at a higher level of resolution. For instance, the strong Nondeterministic Hierarchy Theorem shows $\NTIME(n) \subsetneq \NTIME\left(n^2\right)$. Hence, $\coNTIME(n) \subsetneq \coNTIME\left(n^2\right)$ by symmetry. And further $\NTIME(n) \neq \coNTIME\left(n^2\right)$ by the same argument as in Theorem III. But note that this is no longer a strict containment. And indeed it seems likely that $\NTIME(n)$ also contains something that's not in $\coNTIME\left(n^2\right)$. But it's when we get to the center that things get really hairy. We can use repeated padding to show that if
\[
\NTIME(n) \cap \coNTIME(n) = \NTIME\left(n^2\right) \cap \coNTIME\left(n^2\right),
\]
then
\[
\NTIME(n) \cap \coNTIME(n) = \NTIME\left(n^\text{googolplex}\right) \cap \coNTIME\left(n^\text{googolplex}\right).
\]
A rather dubious proposition to say the least. But our proof for Theorem V no longer works here. There was brute force involved at one point. And that's no longer available to us if we want to stay within the range of polynomials.

Finally, a perhaps even more basic consideration: By Theorem X we know that there exist problems in $\interEXP$ that aren't in $\unionP$. So then where are they? Can we actually point out a concrete problem which separates these classes the way we can in the case of $\NP \subsetneq \NEXP$?
